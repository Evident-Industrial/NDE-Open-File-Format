The **NDE Open File Format** refers to any data file stored using the [HDF5 container library](https://www.hdfgroup.org/) and [JSON](https://www.json.org/) text format following the HDF5 Structure and JSON Metadata requirements detailed in [the documentation](https://ndeformat.com/). Such a file should be saved using the **.nde** extension. 

The NDE Open File Format is designed for storing nondestructive testing (NDT) data. It is platform-independent and modality-agnostic, offering a relatively simple file structure for mainstream NDT applications while supporting future complex solutions and technologies. It currently supports the Ultrasonic (UT) modality and will soon support the Eddy Current (ET) modality.

## Documentation 

The official documentation of the .NDE Open File Format is available at [ndeformat.com](https://ndeformat.com/) and is generated from the files located in the "site" directory of this repository.
