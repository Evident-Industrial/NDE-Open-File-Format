This major update is scheduled for release around November this year.\u00a0</p> <p>Version 4.0 will pave the way for supporting Eddy Current modality and advanced ultrasonic functionalities such as FMC, HMC, and PWI. The new data structure is designed to seamlessly adapt and accommodate future requirements or needs. We developed this new version with versatility and simplicity in mind, catering to both the simplest and most complex use cases.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>Please note that this new version will introduce breaking changes which you should consider for your future developments. </p> <p>This is a preliminar version of .NDE 4.0 documentation solely intended to inform the user on upcoming updates. Changes and updates can still be made, especially regarding semantics. Do not use the information contained on this page as an official release. If you are not yet using the .NDE format for custom applications, we recommend waiting for the official release to be published. </p> <p>This version of the documentation is a living document that was last updated on June 11, 2024. See the history page for more details.</p> <p>To communicate with the development team for support, to provide feedback or to be added to our mailing list for updates, please reach out to nde_support@evidentscientific.com.</p> <p>The .NDE file format is designed for storage of nondestructive testing (NDT) data. It is platform-independent and modality-agnostic.  It provides a relatively simple file structure for mainstream NDT applications while enabling support for future complex solutions and technologies. Data is stored using the HDF5 file format combined with a JSON text format describing the associated metadata. </p> <p>This documentation details the requirements that a .NDE file must fulfill through two main standardized aspects: </p> <ul> <li>The HDF5 structure containing the data</li> <li>The JSON Setup dataset describing the associated metadata that can be validated against a JSON schema. </li> </ul> <p>The .NDE file format is one of the primary interfaces of the Unified NDT Inspection Software (UNIS) platform currently being developed by Evident. The .NDE file format will be supported by all future NDT software applications developed by Evident.</p> <p>UNIS is an open platform that can be used by all stakeholders in the NDE world to enable NDE 4.0 and accelerate software development.</p>"},{"location":"#about","title":"About","text":""},{"location":"#license","title":"License","text":"<p>The .NDE format is distributed under an MIT license.</p>"},{"location":"#support","title":"Support","text":"<p>To communicate with the development team for support or to provide feedback, please contact nde_support@evidentscientific.com.</p>"},{"location":"examples/","title":"Examples","text":"<p>Examples of the same files in .NDE version 3.3 and 4.0 are provide below for 3 common use cases. </p>"},{"location":"examples/#manual-weld-scanning-using-conventional-ultrasound","title":"Manual Weld Scanning using Conventional Ultrasound","text":"<p>In this example, a weld bead on a 26 mm thick stainless steel plate is manually scanned using a C550 3.5 MHz single-element angle beam transducer mounted on a SPE2-60S-IHC 39\u00b0 wedge.

New UNIS-based software applications from Evident will natively support the .NDE file format. However, for Evident software applications that existed prior to introducing the .NDE open file format, the support is currently limited.</p> Will Evident charge its customers to access their data and read .NDE files in the future? <p>No. The .NDE file format is built on an open-source mindset and technical foundations (such as HDF5 and JSON). Therefore, access to the data stored in .NDE files will always be free and open (with the exception of the private section of the file under \"/Applications\" which is not documented nor standardized). Our users own their data and should be free to use it as they want.</p>"},{"location":"history/","title":"History","text":""},{"location":"history/#06102024-initial-publication-of-nde-40-pre-release-page","title":"06/10/2024 Initial publication of .NDE 4.0 pre-release page.","text":""},{"location":"history/#06112024-update-of-the-info-message-on-overview-page","title":"06/11/2024 Update of the Info message on Overview page.","text":""},{"location":"whats-new-4.0/","title":"What's new in 4.0","text":""},{"location":"whats-new-4.0/#motivations","title":"Motivations","text":"<p>The existing version of the .NDE file format has limited support for Eddy current modality, advanced ultrasonic features, and future developments.
