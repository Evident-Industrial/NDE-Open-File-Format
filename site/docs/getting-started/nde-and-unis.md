The .NDE file format is one of the primary interfaces of the Unified NDT Inspection Software (UNIS) platform currently being developed by [Evident](https://www.evidentscientific.com/en/). It was first introduced on the OmniScan X3 in October 2022 with the release of MXU 5.11. The .NDE file format will be supported by all future NDT software applications developed by Evident.

It is based on open standards and technologies, allowing data exchange through an open file format, and provide open APIs to control Evident instruments.
