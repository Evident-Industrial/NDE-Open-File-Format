# Collaboration

## Collaborate with Evident

[Evident](https://www.evidentscientific.com/en/) currently controls the specifications of the NDE Open File Format and its releases while remaining open to collaboration to extend it to other modalities or add new features. Since the format is based on open-source technologies, anyone is free to reuse or modify it for their own purposes.

Hence, we encourage other **vendors**, **service providers**, **asset owners** and **academics** to [reach out to us](mailto:nde_support@evidentscientific.com) if you think there would be interest to partner in a collaborative effort, for improving and adding new functionalities to the NDE Open File Format. 

Moreover, as Evident invests significant resources and effort to provide comprehensive support and development, any new collaborator or contributor should be prepared to dedicate substantial time and effort to achieve the same level of testing and documentation that we currently maintain.

## Engaged with other initiatives

[Evident](https://www.evidentscientific.com/en/) is also involved in other initiatives and working groups, such as those led by [EPRI](https://www.epri.com/) in the US and [COFREND](https://www.cofrend.com/) in France. Our goal is to offer insights and share experiences towards developing an open file format, while discussing new functionalities and improvements for the future. Many initiatives aim to create export formats, whereas we developed .NDE Open File Format with versatility in mind, allowing it to serve as a native format for any instrument or software.

## Experimental features

<!-- md:flag experimental --> 

You may find features or properties tagged as throughout the documentation. These features are considered for future releases but are not yet officially integrated into the .NDE File Format. This allows us to share ongoing developments with you while awaiting final decisions and approval. We welcome [your feedback](mailto:nde_support@evidentscientific.com) on these features to help us refine their final versions.
